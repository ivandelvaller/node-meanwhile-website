    <hr>
    <p class="text-justify">I have worked with <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong> since <strong>2014</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript/TypeScript</strong> to create dynamic content in different personal websites since <strong>2020</strong>. <br> 
    I love open-source, that's the reason I use JavaScript in almost all my projects, and why I'm getting experience in technologies like <strong>Node js</strong>, <strong>Mongodb</strong> and more recenttly <strong>React js</strong> with <strong> REDUX</strong>.
    As a <em>Computer Systems Technician</em>, I know and understand other programming languages such as <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>PHP,</strong> <strong>Python</strong> <em>(with Django)</em> and <strong>C</strong>. <br>
    My objective is to be a fullstack developer..
